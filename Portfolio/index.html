                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>     I've acquired eight years of photography experience working with people from all walks of life. I have been very fortunate to experiece working with various mentorsgaining opportunities to hone my craft. I love working with businesses within the fashion, health, and wellness industries. While my heart belongs to many of those areas, I have experience working in different spaces such as e-commerce photography, weddings, and even seniors.</p> <br>
                <p>     I have a signature style of bright bold colors, but I also love exploring different color-grading techniques in order to meet the needs of my clients. What truly sets me apart from other photographers is my dedication to detail within smaller moments. Those fine details can truly capture the tone and narrative that is able to elevate a brand.</p> <br>
                <p>     I am currently a senior attending the University of Wisconsin- Eau Claire. My plans in the spring entail looking for a role in content creation or photography to compliment my Advertisement degree and photography skillset.</p>
